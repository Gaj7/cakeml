## REQUIREMENTS

* A OCaml compiler with compatible complier-libs.

  4.01.0 seems to work, but 4.02.1 does not work due to changes to the
  type expressions syntax. For even newer versions, the environment gotten
  from Toploop (i.e. `Toploop.toplevel_env ()`) seems to not contain the
  necessary things. The simplest way to get the necessary tools seems to be
  using opam:

  > opam switch 4.01.0

* camlp5, num and HOL light installed. HOL light is available from
  https://github.com/jrh13/hol-light/. These tools were tested on the
  commit with SHA 6bc76990b. The camlp5 and num libraries are necessary
  for both HOL light and this tool, and can be installed easily using opam:

  > opam install camlp5 num

* Ensure that the environment variable HOLLIGHT_DIR points to the location where
  you built HOL light.

## USAGE

The tool is used as follows.

1. Build the AST module and make the custom OCaml toplevel (REPL) `ocamltop_j`
   by calling make:

   > make

2. Run the tool using the custom script `ocaml_j`:

   > sh ocaml_j

3. Load and run the main script by typing the following into the REPL:

   > #use "do_hol.ml";;

   Note that the `#` is not optional; it is part of the use directive. Any
   commands must be terminated by ';;' for the REPL to accept them.

If all goes well, a directory `sml/` containing the resulting translated files
will appear.
